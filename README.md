## What it does
I have designed a program that sends a customized message every particular interval of time, here it is every hour.
## How we built it
I built it using Javascript, Node.js, node-cron, Twilio.
## Challenges I ran into
This is my **first project** using Javascript, Node.js, Twilio and had to learn _everything from scratch_ . 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It sends message every hour without any bugs.
## What we learned
I learnt how to use Twilio in project, its implementation and how it works etc.
## What's next for this program
Make discord bot that does the same in discord DM's
