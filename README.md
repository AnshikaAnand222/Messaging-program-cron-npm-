## Inspiration
Valentine’s Day occurs every February 14. Across India and in other places around the world, candy, flowers, gifts and love messages are exchanged between loved ones, all in the name of St. Valentine. Valentine was a priest who served during the third century in Rome. When Emperor Claudius II decided that single men made better soldiers than those with wives and families, he outlawed marriage for young men. Valentine, realizing the injustice of the decree, defied Claudius and continued to perform marriages for young lovers in secret. When Valentine’s actions were discovered, Claudius ordered that he be put to death.

Inspired from good deeds of St. Valentine, we made this project **"Words For Love"** . To let our loved one know how much we love them.
## What it does
I have designed a program that sends our loved ones a customized message every hour on Valentine's Day to let them know how much you care for them and what they meant to you.
## How we built it
I built it using Javascript, Node.js, node-cron, Twilio.
## Challenges I ran into
This is my **first project** using Javascript, Node.js, Twilio and had to learn _everything from scratch_ . 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It sends message every hour without any bugs.
## What we learned
I learnt how to use Twilio in project, its implementation and how it works etc.
## What's next for Words For Love
Make discord bot that does the same in discord DM's
